   Xinu is a layered, process-based operating system.  A detailed
description can be found in the text:

        Comer, Douglas E., Operating System Design: The Xinu
          Approach, Prentice-Hall, 1984.

This directory contains version 7 of the software (including Internet
protocol software and a user interface shell), and is described in:

        Comer, Douglas E., Operating System Design Vol 2:
          Internetworking with Xinu, Prentice-Hall, 1987.

   To run the software on this tape, you will need at least 2 Sun 3
workstations.  The workstations are arranged in pairs, with the
frontend machine serving as the editing and compiling machine, and
the backend workstation being used to test the software.  Each pair
of machines must be connected to the local network, and they must
have an RS232 line connecting their two A serial ports.
   The tape is self-contained.  It contains source programs for
both Xinu and the development system.  The tape can be read into
any directory.  These programs do not need to be placed in system
directories unless you want to do so.
  Once downloaded, the micro runs independently, communicating
with the VAX or other machines over an Ethernet, using standard DARPA
Internet protocols (sometimes called TCP/IP).
   We have attempted to keep most of the software identical to that
published in the above text.  Almost all of the higher level
software is identical.  The low level software, in many cases, had
to be rewritten to some extent.  At the very least, we have
attempted to maintain the function of each source file, even if the
code has been significantly changed.
   Since the machines are arranged in pairs, there is currently no
support for specifying which machine to download to, nor is there
any support for an 'lusers' command.  Also, because of the current
setup, we have not written a 'download' command, as it's function is
simply left to the user under the Sun monitor program.  Code to
support such a distributed system is currently being designed, and
will probably be available via ftp when it is finished.
   This code assumes that you have some machines on your network which
are capable of supplying the standard RARP, time, and Domain Name services.


Installation
------------

   Choose a directory for the Xinu software.  You need not be
in this directory to cross-compile or download programs -- it's
merely the place to store the Xinu software.  Moving the soft-
ware to another directory requires recompilation (i.e., re-
installation).  Choosing /usr/xinu7 as the directory will save
time during installation because binary files on the tape are
compiled for that directory.  Throughout this documentation the
directory into which you place Xinu is denoted {Xinu-directory}.

   Make the Xinu directory and read in the tape by typing the
following commands:

        mkdir {Xinu-directory}
        cd {Xinu-directory}
        tar xbf 20 /dev/rmt0    (your 1600 bpi tape device may
                                 be named something other than
                                 /dev/rmt0)

   Make a symbolic link from /usr/xinu7 to the directory you chose to
avoid recompilation.  You will need super user privilege to do so. This
step is optional:

        su
        ...supply super user password when asked...
        ln -s {Xinu-directory} /usr/xinu7
        CONTROL-d (to leave super user mode)

Once the tape has been read, you must change all source programs
that refer to {Xinu-directory} and recompile the binaries.  A
shell script has been provided to do this for you.  To use it,
move to the installation directory and run Install.  NOTE: YOU
MUST BE IN THE INSTALLATION DIRECTORY {Xinu-directory}/install
WHEN YOU EXECUTE THIS SCRIPT OR IT WILL NOT WORK.

        cd {Xinu-directory}/install
        ./Install



Physical Description
-------- -----------

Let me describe the configuration under which we run Xinu on the
Sun-3/50.  The layout in the Xinu lab looks like this:

        |    |    Sun     |      serial      |    Sun     |     |
        |    |            |                  |            |     |
        |    --------------                  --------------     |


The front end Sun (F) is connected to the back end Sun (B) with both
a 9600 bps serial line and a 10 Mbps ethernet.  F is a full Sun-3/50
with keyboard, monitor, and in our case, a 78 Mbyte disk drive, although
a diskless workstation will perform just as well.  B is a cpu box only;
no keyboard, monitor, or disk.  B is configured to treat serial port
A as its console for both input and output.

We use a program called odt (an acronym from the LSI-11 "on-line
debugging technique", which we have kept for historical reasons) that
connects to serial port A on F and allows prom monitor commands
and tty input to be sent to B via the serial line.  This works
especially well if the user on F is running a windowing environment.

Setup
-----

In order for the Suns to communicate as above, the backend Sun
must consider serial port A to be its console device.  Neatly
enough, if you boot a Sun-3 without a keyboard, it automatically
does this, at least on input.  However, to work fully, the EEPROM
needs to be changed so that B will automatically use the serial
port as the console.  At this point, it is strongly recommended that
you look in "Installing Unix on the Sun Workstation," Appendix D, "the
PROM Monitor and the EEPROM."  It contains full reference for that
which will only be passed over lightly here.

To set up the backend Sun (you must do this part with a keyboard
and monitor attached):

1) hit L1-a     (should transfer control to the EEPROM monitor)
2) type "q 1f[return]"  ([return] is the return key)
3) type "10[return]"
4) type " [return]"     (space then return)

Also, it speeds up the boot process if the back-end sun automatically
uses the ethernet as the default boot device.  You will need to
know whether your Sun uses the lance ethernet controller (le) or
the intel ethernet controller (ie).

1) hit L1-a
2) type "q 18[return]"
3) type "12[return]"    This code tells the Sun not to do
                        device polling, but to boot from
                        the device specified in the following
                        locations.
4) type "69[return]"    Hex code for "i".  If your Sun uses
                        the lance ethernet, you need the hex
                        code for "l", which is 6c.
5) type "0[return]"     Literal 0.
6) type "0[return]"     Literal 0.
7) type "0[return]"     Literal 0.
8) type " [return]"     space return, exits programming of
                        EEPROM Monitor.

This programs the back-end Sun to boot from device ie(0,0,0),
or le(0,0,0) depending on the value entered above.

So, on to booting.  B is put in prom monitor mode by sending
a break down the serial line (a \^@ in odt does this).  The user
then issues a boot instruction for B, which rarps over the ethernet
to find its IP address, and then uses the tftp protocol which
is stored in ROM to download the Xinu operating system from F,
still using the ethernet.  B will also boot automatically after
a power cycle.

To aid in debugging, the Sun version of Xinu uses an autostart
option on the boot command.  If you use the command "b" from the
monitor prompt, the Xinu code will be loaded, and the monitor
prompt will return.  From that point, you can start the Xinu system
by typing "g 4000", which will branch to the loaded Xinu system.
If you want to automatically start the system, then the command is
"b -aN" where N is optional, and is a number of seconds to delay
before starting.  If the N is omitted, the system will start
immediately.


Boot setup
----------
    When a diskless sun boots, it tries to determine its IP
address.  To do this, it sends out a RARP packet, which is
answered by any other machine which knows the IP address which
corresponds to the Sun's physical address.  The booting sun will
then request a boot file via TFTP from the FIRST machine which
answered the RARP request.  In order for our boot sequence to work
correctly, the front end Sun should have an entry for the back end
sun in its file "/etc/ethers", which binds physical addresses to
IP addresses, and it must also be running "rarpd".  The only file
which the booting back end Sun can request is
"/tftpboot/AABBCCDD", where AABBCCDD is the hex representation of
the IP address of the back end Sun.  We make this file a symbolic
link to the file "a.out" in the same directory.  For example,
the /tftpboot directory for a front end Sun connected to a back
end Sun with IP address 128.10.2.89 would look like:
     1 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root        5 Sep  2 15:58 800A0259 -> a.out
    18 -rw-rw-r--  1 sdo     17528 Oct 26 13:39 a.out
Note that both files must be world readable.    

Note: using yellow pages may cause difficulty in the above sequence.
If you are running yellow pages, you should either turn yellow
pages off (a drastic step) or put an entry for the back-end Sun
in the /etc/ethers of your boot server.  However, the link in
/tftpboot should still be present only on the front-end Sun.
It is the presence of this file that determines who answers
the RARP request.  

The code is written to run under Sun 3.4 Unix, using its C compiler,
loader and assembler.  


Final Installation
----- ------------

   To complete installation you must recompile source programs
that contain references to the Xinu directory.  Shell scripts
have been provided to do the job.  For details, see file
README in the installation directory:

        cd {Xinu-directory}/install
        cat README

Network Servers
------- -------

   Now that installation is complete, you need to Configure the Xinu
kernel software itself, and recompile it.  To do so, you must choose
internet addresses for the domain name server, time server, and remote
file server machines.  You can start the remote file server yourself
on the VAX.  It is found in {Xinu-directory}/bin/fs.  You need to know
the internet address of the VAX where fs runs, as well as the internet
address of the machine that runs a time server (UDP port 37) and the
internet address of a machine that runs a domain name server (UDP port
53).  Ask your local network guru to tell you these internet addresses
(in dotted decimal notation) and modify the SERVER constants found near
the end of file {Xinu-directory}/src/sys/sys/Configuration.  If you do
not have an assigned Internet address for your network (i.e., your network
does not connect to the DARPA Internet), choose network an address for it.
Using 128.10.2.0 (Which is actually the address of an Ethernet at Purdue),
means you won't have to recompile the kernel.

        cd {Xinu-directory}/src/sys/sys
        ...edit file Configuration; change SERVER address constants...
        make install

Remote File Server
------ ---- ------

   The remote file server answers queries from the network and reads/writes
files as directed.  If you run the file server on your VAX, then the file
server has the permissions of the user who starts it.  We recommend that you
install a new user account (e.g., "xinu"), and always execute the file server
as that user.  Also, you should understand that the file server makes all
world-readable files accessible over the network.  if you connect to the
DARPA Internet, it makes world-readable files accessible from foreign sites.
   The file server comes configured to use UDP port 2001.  Check with your
local network guru to make sure 2001 is not in use, and if it is, choose a
new port number for the file server.  Change the default port in the software
in {Xinu-directory}/src/fs or just use the -p option when invoking fs.  You
must also change the port number that the kernel uses - it can be found in
file {Xinu-directory}/src/sys/sys/Configuration.
   Start the file server:

        ...login to the VAX under the account that owns the file server...
        {Xinu-directory}/bin/fs
        logout


Try Running Xinu
--- ------- ----

   Now that you have a network running RARP, time, and name servers,
you can boot xinu.  Download and run it.

        cd to the directory with the a.out image
        make download
        odt
        ...you should get Xinu boot message and login prompt...
        type any login
        ...you should get prompt with machine name in it...
        ...try commands such as the following...
        ps
        date
        dg
        help
        mount
        ...try accessing remote files as follows...
        rls /
        cat > /tmp/junk
        Hi there - this is a file
        created from Xinu
        CONTROL-D
        cat /tmp/junk
        ...you should see what you just created...

Differences between V7 Sun and V7 LSI
----------- ------- -- --- --- -- ---
The system should behave like it did in the original LSI version.  The
ethernet drivers are all different, but the interface is unchanged.


Differences between V7 Sun and V6 Sun
----------- ------- -- --- --- -- ---
All of the bug fixes from version 6 have been applied to this code as
well.  In addition, the routines that manipulate the status register
have all been changed.  The changed routines are disable(), restore(),
enable(), pause(), and halt().  They were previously macros defined in
kernel.h that were excpanded inline into asm("") calls.  These macros
turned the Sun optimizing compiler into something more closely
resembling a "randomizing" compiler, so you could not run Version 6 xinu
with the optimizer enabled.  In this version, these routines are
written as assembly language subroutines, and can be found in the file
intr.s.  In version 6, disable() and restore() did not take arguments,
rather, disable() pushed the old status word onto the stack, and
restore() expected to find it there.  This caused some problems, and
proved hard to understand.  In version 7, both routines MUST be passed
a pointer to a short which holds the status register contents.  We
recommend that you use the new typedef in kernel.h, STATWORD, to
define the variables of this type.  For example, you might write a
routine as follows:

     test()
     {
         STATWORD ps;
         disable(ps);
         critical_section();
         restore(ps);
     }

Note that we have not explicitely passed the address of ps.  That is
because STATWORD defines ps to be of type short[1], so any reference
to its name will generate the lvalue, or the address.  This is a trick
from the memory marking routines, and is used so that you can't forget
to pass the address of ps, rather than the contents, which will
probably cause a panic.
